# Table Stacker 
- User can use [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) to create an executable file (e.g. `exe` on Windows system, `app` on MacOS) or download the pre-made Windows system executable file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O475gFbi-R6ixo-WmGjgCpb3CTfIFnHA/view?usp=drive_link). 
---
## Caveats
- Best practise is to create a new virtual environment and only install the required packages. It would reduce the executable file size (Assumed user uses the basic command to create the executable file).
