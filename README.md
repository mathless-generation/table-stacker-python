# Table Stacker 
- This is a program that combines tables in CSV, Excel (only the first sheet would be selected) or PDF files.
- User can use [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) to create an executable file (e.g. `exe` on Windows system, `app` on MacOS).
---
## Caveats
- Best practise is to create a new virtual environment and only install the required packages. It would reduce the executable file size (Assume user uses the basic command to create the executable file).
